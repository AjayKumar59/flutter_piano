# flutter_piano

A Crossplatform Midi Piano built with Flutter.

## Getting Started

This application only runs in landscape mode, orientation is set in the AndroidManifest.xml and in the Runner.xcworspace settings.

Make sure to turn your volume up and unmute the phone if possible, the application will try to unmute the device but it can be overriden.

The first section is the deepest notes so if you scroll to the right it will be much louder.

## Configuration

Optionally the key width can be changed in the settings for adjusting for densitity.

The key labels can also be turned off if you want a more minimal look.
